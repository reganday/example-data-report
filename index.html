            <h2>1. Introduction</h2></section>
        <p> According to PEW Research<sup>
            <ahttps://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/19/online-reviews/>
        
        1</a></sup>, 96% of adults between 18-29 occasionally consult reviews before making a
            purchase. But does this mean that higher ratings result in more product sales? Specifically, what do
            higher ratings indicate for video game sales? Maybe higher ratings lead to more game sales. But could
            some more obscure games with a dedicated group of followers receive higher ratings than popular
            games with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether there has been an increase in the
            production of games in recent years and, if so, what affect this increase has on the quality of games
            based on review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number of games results in review scores
            decreasing with the oversaturation of video game releases?</p>
            
        <p>In this project, I plan to use Metacritic's user and critic review scores to see if there is a correlation
            between the scores of a game and its overall sales. I will be joining the review data with sales data
            obtained from VGChartz. </p>

        <section><h2>2. Data</h2></section>
        <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>
        <p>I collected data from Metacritic, which contained user (user score) and critic (meta score) review scores
            for each game.</p>
            <p>Metacritic's data was found on 186 different web pages. I wrote a web crawling script to collect all data
            across these 186 pages. I collected the game title, summary, platform, user score, meta score, and
            release date for 18,526 games. Some of the results were the same game that was released on different
            platforms, which is essential to consider when I begin merging the data. I created a data frame which is
            contained in the Metacritic.csv file in the project folder. The web crawling script that I wrote is
            contained in the metacritic.R file in the project folder.</p>
           <p> The data didn’t need much cleaning; however, to make the platform match with the VGChartz data, I
            created a dictionary to convert Metacritic’s platform data to match VGChartz. This cleaning was done in
            the file combining_vgs.R.</p>
            <p>This project uses two primary sources of data: Metacritic's2 game critic and game player review scores
                of different games and VGChartz3 data about video game sales</p>
        <h3>2.2 Video Game Sales</h3>
        <p>The website VGChartz provides sales data about the number of units of each game/platform
            combination sold.</p>
        <p>The information was contained in 1,249 web pages. Due to the extensive nature of the data, I decided to
            break the web crawling results into six different CSV files (VGChartz_0 – 5.csv), all contained in the
            project folder. The web crawling script is contained in the vgchartz.R file in the project folder.
            I collected the game, platform, release date, publisher, and sales data from PAL, Japan, and North
            America as well as total game sales for 62,398 games. Like the Metacritic data, some of these games
            were released on multiple platforms, which count as a unique observation in the data. Another
            interesting thing to note is that series were counted in this data frame alongside their individual
            counterparts. For example, Super Mario is counted as a series, but each entry in the series is also
            contained in the dataset. This was handled in the cleaning of the data.</p>
        <p>In cleaning the data, I merged all six VGChartz .csv files into one complete file using row bind to build a
            complete data frame. I also removed unnecessary columns, trimmed the white space on the title, and
            returned only the distinct values of the dataset. When I read the CSV into the script, I created NA values
            where data was missing. I also removed the game series by filtering them out during data cleaning. This
            cleaning was done in the file combining_vgs.R.</p>
